The White Wine dataset consists of 13 variables, with almost 5,000 observations.


```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots1}
# Plot X histogram
ggplot(aes(x = X), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(bins = length(wine$X)) 

# Plot X line graph with augmented binsize
ggplot(aes(x = X, y = X), data = wine) +
  geom_line()

# Get X statistical values
summary(wine$X)
```


Within the 'wine' df, the 'X' feature acts as an unique ID for each wine given within the df.


```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots2}
# Plot fixed.acidity histogram
ggplot(aes(x = fixed.acidity), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)

# Plot fixed.acidity histogram with augmented histogram
ggplot(aes(x = fixed.acidity), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +
  scale_x_continuous(limit = c(4, 11), 
                     breaks = c(seq(4, 11, by = 0.5)))

# Get fixed.acidity statistical values
summary(wine$fixed.acidity)
```


From the dataset documentation:

* fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3): most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)

The 'fixed.acidity' feature seems to have a wide range of values, normally distrubuted around 6.80. There are some outliers within the wine dataset, which have a 'fixed.acidity' value greater than 11. The 'fixed.acidity' ranges in values from 3.80 to 14.20.


```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots3}
# Plot volatile.acidity histogram
ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)

# Plot volatile.acidity histogram with augmented histogram
ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  scale_x_continuous(limit = c(0.1, 0.7), 
                     breaks = c(seq(0.1, 0.7, by = 0.1)))

# Get volatile.acidity statistical values
summary(wine$volatile.acidity)
```


From the dataset documentation:

* volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3): the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

The 'volatile.acidity' feature seems to have a long tail, being positively skewed. The second histogram cuts out the outliers on the few high end values for a more detailed inspection of the bulk of the data. The values for 'volatile.acidity' are centered around the median of 0.26, with a mean of 0.28. The values of 'volatile.acidity' range from 0.08 to 1.10. Based on the description given by the dataset documentation, keeping the 'volatile.acidity' values low would be in the best interest of the consumer.


```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots4}
# Plot citric.acid histogram
ggplot(aes(x = citric.acid), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)

# Plot citric.acid histogram with augmented histogram
ggplot(aes(x = citric.acid), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  scale_x_continuous(limit = c(0.1, 0.8), 
                     breaks = c(seq(0.1, 0.8, by = 0.1)))

# Get citric.acid statistical values
summary(wine$citric.acid)
```


From the dataset documentation:

* citric acid (g / dm^3): found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines

The 'citric.acid' feature seems to have a long tail, bring positively skewed. The values for 'citric.acid' are centered around the median of 0.32, with a mean of 0.33. The values of 'citric.acid' range from 0.00 to 1.66. There is a huge spike in the count of 'citric.acid' at 0.5, this could possibly an industry agreed "sweet spot". Based on the description given by the dataset documentation, keeping the 'citric acid' values high would be in the best interest of the consumer.


```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots5}
# Plot residual.sugar histogram
ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)

# Plot residual.sugar histogram with limits
ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 21),
                     breaks = c(seq(0, 21, by = 1)))

# Get residual.sugar statistical values
summary(wine$residual.sugar)
```

From the dataset documentation:

* residual sugar (g / dm^3): the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet

The 'residual.sugar' feature seems to have a long tail, being positively skewed. The values for residual sugar have high consentrations and spike around the values of 1 and 2, later dropping off. The median for residual sugar is 5.20, with a mean of 6.39.


```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots6}
# Plot chlorides histogram
ggplot(aes(x = chlorides), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)

# Plot chlorides histogram with limits
ggplot(aes(x = chlorides), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.001) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 0.2),
                     breaks = c(seq(0, 0.2, by = 0.01)))

# Get residual.sugar statistical values
summary(wine$chlorides)
```


From the dataset documentation:

* chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3): the amount of salt in the wine

The 'chlorides' feature looks normally distributed around the median of 0.043, with a mean of 0.046 but, the data does have a long tail to the right that makes up a small portion of the overall wines. It would make sense for wines to have the smallest amount of salt possible due to wines not being known for their high salinity.
