```{r echo=FALSE, Load_the_Data}
# Load the Data
wine <- read.csv(file = 'wineQualityWhites.csv', head = TRUE, sep = ',')
```


# Univariate Plots Section
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots0}
# Plot X histogram
ggplot(aes(x = X), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(bins = length(wine$X)) 

# Plot X line graph with augmented binsize
ggplot(aes(x = X, y = X), data = wine) +
  geom_line()

# Get X statistical values
summary(wine$X)
```

Within the 'wine' df, the 'X' feature acts as an unique ID for each wine given within the df.


```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots1}
# Plot fixed.acidity histogram
ggplot(aes(x = fixed.acidity), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)

# Plot fixed.acidity histogram with augmented histogram
ggplot(aes(x = fixed.acidity), data = wine) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +
  scale_x_continuous(limit = c(4, 11), 
                     breaks = c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11))

# Get X statistical values
summary(wine$fixed.acidity)
```

The 'fixed.acidity' feature seems to have a wide range of values, normally distrubuted around 6.8. There are some outliers within the wine dataset, which have a 'fixed.acidity' value greater than 11.



The White Wine dataset consists of 13 variables, with almost 5,000 observations.

# Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?
There are 4898 wines of 13 features (x, fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, citric.acid, residual.sugar, cholorides, free.sulfur.dioxide, total.sulfur.dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, quality). All of these variables are given as quanitavive variables.

Other observations:
* The 'quality' distrubution is approximately normal
* The median 'quality' value is 6.0

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?



# Bivariate Plots Section
```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}

```

# Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?

### What was the strongest relationship you found?




# Multivariate Plots Section

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots}

```

# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

### OPTIONAL: Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the strengths and limitations of your model.
